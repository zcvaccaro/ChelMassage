          <p>Deep Tissue massage is a highly effective method for releasing chronic stress areas due to misalignment,
            repetitive motions, and past injuries. The technique involves slow, deliberate strokes and deep finger pressure on contracted areas,
            either following or going across the grain of muscles, tendons, and fascia. It is particularly beneficial for those with chronic pain,
            limited mobility, and persistent muscle tension.
            While the pressure is firm, it is customized to your comfort level to ensure a therapeutic and restorative experience.</p>

          <p>The Swedish massage is the cornerstone of modern Western massage, designed to relax the entire body.
            This is achieved by rubbing the muscles with long, gliding strokes in the direction of blood returning to the heart.
            Additional techniques include circular pressure, firm kneading, and gentle tapping.
            It is an excellent choice for first-time massage clients or anyone seeking to manage stress and promote a sense of profound tranquility.
            Benefits include increased oxygen levels in the blood, decreased muscle toxins, and improved circulation and flexibility.</p>

          <p>Prenatal massage is a therapeutic bodywork that focuses on the special needs of the mother-to-be as her body goes through the
            dramatic changes of pregnancy. It enhances the function of muscles and joints, improves circulation and general body tone,
            and relieves mental and physical fatigue. Using specialized, gentle techniques and supportive pillows for safe positioning,
            this massage helps to alleviate common discomforts such as backaches, stiff neck, leg cramps, and swelling. It is a natural,
            touch-based way to support the physiological and emotional well-being of both mother and baby.</p>

          <img src="https://picsum.photos/300/200?random=4" alt="Myofascial Release">
          <p>Myofascial Release (MFR) is a safe and highly effective hands-on technique that involves applying gentle,
            sustained pressure into the myofascial connective tissue restrictions to eliminate pain and restore motion.
            This specialized approach addresses the fascial system—the web of connective tissue that surrounds and supports your muscles.
            By releasing tension in the fascia, MFR can have profound effects on body alignment, mobility, and pain patterns.
            It is an excellent therapy for treating chronic pain, postural issues, and restricted movement.</p>
